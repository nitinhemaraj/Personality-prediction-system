# Personality-prediction-system
The project is an endeavor that focuses on using computer vision and machine learning techniques to analyze facial expressions and visual cues in order to predict an individual's personality traits.

## Features

### Facial Expression Analysis
Utilizes computer vision algorithms to recognize and analyze facial expressions and microexpressions in real time.
### Personality Trait Prediction
Predicts personality traits based on the detected facial expressions and visual cues using machine learning models.
### Real-time Feedback
Provides immediate feedback on the individual's personality traits or emotional state.
### Customizable Models
Users can train and fine-tune the personality prediction model to suit specific applications and contexts.
### Ethical Considerations
Includes options to ensure data privacy and adhere to ethical guidelines in personality analysis.
